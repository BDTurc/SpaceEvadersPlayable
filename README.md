Submission for PurpleMonkey Game Jam's Theme:  Let Our Powers Combine

In this game, you must cooperate with a teammate to make it as far as possible through the spaceship. 
Each player has a primary color, and you must work together to mix your primary colors to match 
the colors of the lasers. If you match correctly, you pass through unharmed. If not... well, then you die.


The game was originally developed for two xbox controllers, but can also be played by sharing 
a keyboard with your friend.

Xbox: Left & Right Bumper change your selection, A chooses that character

Keyboard: A & D for Player 1 and <- and -> for Player 2 change selection.
